Spin Microposit S1818 at 4000rpm for 30 seconds. According to the S1800 series datasheet \cite{s18}, the resist thickness will be the desired $1.8\mu m$.

After spinning the back of the sample was cleaned with cotton bud soaked with acetone. This removes any unwanted photoresist and stops the back of the sample contaminating or sticking to the hotplate.

After spinning the substrate is baked on a hotplate at $115\degree C$ for 120 seconds. \hl{This hardens the photoresist enough so that it does not stick to the photomask and so that the structure does not colapse and distort after exposing.}

The SUSS MicroTec MJB4 mask aligner was used to align the masks on the substrate
