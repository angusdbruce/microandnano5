\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

What is the entire research group working on? What are their short and long term goals?

Where are they with their work? i.e. what have we been given as a starting point?

Why specifically do they require our help? What are problem areas that they're hoping we can sort.

What, therefore, were the aims of our project?

Give an overview of the final designs and briefly discuss how successful it was in relation to the project aims.

Talk about how the rest of the report will be structured and any other necessary disclaimers.

Here's an example equation:

\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
\%_{err}(V) = \left(\frac{R(V)}{R_{avg}}-1\right)\times100
\end{equation}
