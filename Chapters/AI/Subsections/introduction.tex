The research group's ultimate goal for the project is for a user to take a picture of a chip that has been run and for the result to be automatically determined from the image. They have been attempting to build a machine learning algorithm for this task but they would like the design to be more modular. The current chips have 5 strips but if the design were to change in the future, say to 6 strips, the machine learning model would need a large new dataset to train on which would be time consuming.

Our solution was to segregate the strips from the chip. If the strips can be automatically detected on a chip, then the strips can be fed in one by one to a machine learning model that determines the output of the individual strip. This would allow for the chip design to be altered in future so long as the strips stay the same.

From the perspective of user interaction, the group would like a user to take a photograph of the chip and the result to be determined in an app. We had no previous experience with Java or phone application development 

The purpose of the machine learning aspect of this project was to classify the results of the chip
